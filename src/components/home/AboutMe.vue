    I am a software developer who believes that there is no limit to the experiences and knowledge one can gain in the world of software,
    and that something new blossoms every day. Although I started my journey in 2021, I've been around computers since childhood.
    Just like a child playing soccer in the street and taking steps towards becoming a professional,
    I am progressing in the field of software development.

    My main focus is web development, especially web backend and API integrations. From time to time,
    I also work on data scraping and desktop applications. I'm someone who takes daily problems to heart and constantly seeks solutions.
    If you're considering including me in your projects, I would be happy to listen to your ideas and work together to create solutions.
